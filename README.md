## 💭 My Philosophy: Craving Creation

> **"Your website defines how the world perceives you. Build it right, or don't build it at all."**

I believe the best way to predict the future is to **build it**—one line of code at a time. My approach is rooted in **first principles thinking**: strip away assumptions, understand the fundamentals, and construct solutions from the ground up. 

Whether it's a sleek web app, an AI-powered platform, or a consulting strategy, I'm driven by the thrill of transforming ideas into reality. **Craving creation** isn't just a philosophy—it's a way of life. Ship fast, learn faster, iterate relentlessly.

- **[planout.me](https://planout.me)** - Personal project management tool. Built because Notion felt bloated.
- **[typeshitt.vercel.app](https://typeshitt.vercel.app)** - Word counter & rich text editor. Made it because I hate wordcounter.net.

## 🎯 A Note About All This

Look, I'd be lying if I said everything here was perfect. Most of these projects started at 2 AM because I was frustrated with existing solutions or just wanted to try something new. I've failed plenty of times, broken production more than I'd like to admit, and shipped code I later regretted.

**But that's the point.**

This README is the highlight reel. The reality is messier: failed experiments, abandoned repos, features that never shipped. Building stuff means **failing often** and **learning constantly**. If you're not breaking things, you're not pushing hard enough.

So yeah, I'm craving creation—but I'm also craving **growth**, **impact**, and **having fun** while doing it. If that resonates with you, let's build something together.

### 💭 My Personal Mantra

> **"The best code is the code that ships. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good—iterate, improve, and keep building."**
